 Transcribe Podcast Audio Testing
==========================

This is a repository demonstrating transcribing podcast audio with a
few different services: IBM Watson Speech to Text, Google Cloud
Speech, and CMU Sphinx.

Getting Started
===============

First run ``fetch_podcast.sh`` to pull some content down for
converting. The example from my blog post is used, though you can
replace the URL if you like to try with other content.

Running CMU Sphinx
==================

Ensure that sphinx is installed. On Ubuntu this is done with

::

   sudo apt-get install pocketsphinx pocketsphinx-en-us

Then run ``transcribe_with_sphinx.sh``. It will produce
``sphinx-transcription.log`` as output.

Running Watson
==============

Sign up for IBM Bluemix and create a Watson Speech to Text instance.

Copy user/password into auth.cfg in the [watson] section.

Install python prereqs

::

   pip install watson-developer-cloud

Then run it with

::

   watson-transcribe.py podcast.flac

Optionally specify a pretrained customized language id

::

   watson-transcribe.py --customization a13780b0-52b7-1fe7-fbb7-77471c70c949 podcast.flac

.. note::

   It will take 30 - 45 minutes to run, it processes slightly faster
   than realtime.

Running Google
==============

Sign up for Google Cloud and create a project and a service key. Go
through all the setup around authentication -
https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-python/latest/core/auth.html

Create a key for the service, put that json in ``auth.json`` in this
directory.

Install python prereqs

::

   pip install google-cloud-storage google-cloud-speech

Then run it as

::

   google-transcribe.py

.. note::

   It will take 20 - 30 minutes to run, it processes slightly faster
   than realtime.
